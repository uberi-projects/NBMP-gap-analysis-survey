# NBMP Gap Analysis Survey

This repository hosts the HTML code for the National Biodiversity Monitoring Program (NBMP) stakeholder gap analysis survey deployment. The survey is taken through the deployment URL on GitHub Pages, and responses collected using a Google Sheet, connected through a custom Google app.

The HTML was written with extensive support from Codex and Claude Code, with oversight and testing by the UB-ERI team.
